Hi ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶

I'm Nino Filiu a developer & experimental visual artist

Here's where I stash my experiments with generative art, datamosh, shaders, exotic web APIs, and other cool shit.

I open source everything I do because I don't wanne be like other artists out keeping their secrets, I think making art with code is cool and should be democratized, so don't hesitate to use this code to either learn about my techniques & algorithms or even use my code! This repo is licensed under GPLv3 which basically means you can do everything you want with this source code except distribute closed source

Run things locally:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ninofiliu/art
cd art
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
